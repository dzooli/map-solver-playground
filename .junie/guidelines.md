# Project Guidelines

* Junie should run tests to check the correctness of the proposed solution
* Junie should ensure on a refactoring task the working solution should also be working after refactoring.
* Keep the code clean, apply comments only when really needed. We dont want to see comments in every line.
* Try to stick to SOLID design considerations and avoid strong coupling between the software components.
* Keep cognitive complexity below 15 by function and methodwise.
* Keep class method count below 20
* Keep method and function code lines below 30 excluding the comments.
